## Frame 2 - Hidden in plain sight

- scene: A dense contract wall accumulates (page cards with legalese line textures). Red clause flags flare and pin on traps: "Unlimited liability", "Auto-renewal trap", "Forfeiture penalty". Slow zoom-out, then a push-in shoves pages to the edges as a two-part question builds center: "What are you / really agreeing to?"

narrativeRole: Agitate the pain with named, recognizable traps so the relief beat lands hard.
keyMessage: One-sided clauses hide in documents you already sign.

Adapt: keep accumulate-surround-shove signature and the closing serif-weight question; swap tool icons for contract page cards and the avatar morph for named trap flags (story truth - the pain is documents, not app overload).

Scene 1 (0.0-2.5s): #F7F7F7 ground; page cards enter in two staggered groups, slight deterministic rotation scatter, layered-depth 3 layers (back pages dimmed via opacity gradient); each group lands as the VO names a document type; smooth spring-pop settle.
Scene 2 (2.5-6.0s): as each trap is named, its red flag pill pins onto a specific page - three sequential reveals, each a marker-style highlight sweep + pin; flags sit upper-third on their hosts; density rises.
Scene 3 (6.0-8.0s): slow push-in on the wall root; outer pages soften via selective blur so the flagged trio reads focal; surround pressure builds.
Scene 4 (8.0-10.0s): velocity-matched shove - virtual camera pushes in while pages slide to frame edges (viewport-change), opening center negative space; the two-part question builds word-group by word-group (dynamic-content-sequencing), second line lands in #B42318; holds still to the cut.

## Selected blueprint: overwhelm-surround

# overwhelm-surround — Overwhelm / Close-In

**intent**: Convey overwhelm by accumulation. Recognizable subjects assemble, density markers scatter in to amplify "look how much," then the central subject morphs into the viewer's own avatar and elements close in from ALL sides — the frame feels surrounded, not zoomed-into. The emotional arc is recognition → claustrophobia.

**roles served**

- Problem (from `problem-mockup-overwhelm`): when the problem beat must first show "too many tools / too much surface area" and then put **the viewer inside it** — a literal swap of subject (product → person) followed by a closing-in that feels invasive. Reach for it when the pain is "you're buried," not "this metric is bad" (that's `dataviz-countup`).
- Problem (from `desktop-clutter-accumulation`): when the overwhelm is a **workspace**, not a tool
  count — live windows, stickies, and alert toasts pile up until the frame is chaotically full, and
  the beat resolves not by closing in but by shoving the clutter aside and asking the question.
  Reach for this variant when the pain lands on words ("how can you X… when you spend months on
  Y?"), not on a surrounded avatar.

**duration**: 6–9s (clutter-shove-to-question variant ~10s)

**shot structure** (a `[bg]` canvas; recognizable surfaces first, the viewer's avatar revealed underneath, then a radial crowd)

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~1.6s) — recognizable assembly.** Three `[product mockups / surfaces]` assemble into something the viewer knows — staggered scale-in, the **center** one full-size, the two flanks smaller (~0.86). Each rides a low-amplitude float so they feel like live context, not a static collage. Camera static.
- **Scene 2 (~1.6–3.0s) — density amplifies.** `[platform icons / logos]` scatter in around the mockups (staggered), used purely as **density markers** — "look how much surface area," not animated dials.
- **Scene 3 (~3.0–4.6s) — the morph (signature move).** The CENTER mockup MORPHS: its content fades out, the container reshapes, and the viewer's `[avatar]` is revealed **underneath** — a literal swap of subject, product → person.
- **Scene 4 (~4.6–end) — close-in.** `[task bubbles / demands]` close in from ALL sides toward the avatar (radial staggered entry). The avatar **stays put** while the bubbles invade — the claustrophobia comes from being surrounded, never from a camera push. Holds on the crowded state.
- **Variant — clutter-shove-to-question** (replaces Scenes 3–4 and
  inverts the camera contract — see modifier): accumulation runs under a **slow steady zoom-out** —
  `[sticky notes]` bounce in springy, `[dashboard / editor windows]` pop and slide up, a stack of
  `[alert toasts]` slides in at one edge, inner content keeps typing / log-scrolling as live density,
  windows overlap until the frame is chaotically full. The camera then REVERSES into a quick
  push-in that **shoves the clutter to the frame edges**, opening central negative space where a
  `[two-part serif question]` builds word-by-word (line 1 swaps in place to line 2); a `[cursor]`
  glides in from off-frame and comes to rest under the text; a very slow forward creep and hold.
  No morph, no avatar — the question is the payoff.

**motion vocabulary**: staggered scale-in assembly; resting-scale-preserving low float; density-marker icon scatter; content-fade → container-reshape → reveal-anchor-beneath morph; radial close-in entry from all compass points; held crowded end-state. Clutter-shove variant: slow steady zoom-out under accumulation; reverse quick push-in; clutter
shoved to frame edges opening center negative space; continuous live typing / log scroll inside
windows as ambient density; toast-stack slide-in; word-by-word serif build with in-place line swap;
cursor glide-to-rest; very slow forward creep + hold.

**rule mapping**

- staggered mockup + icon entries (smooth settle onto their resting scale) → `spring-pop-entrance` (smooth-settle register) backed by `gsap-effects`
- platform icons as density markers (positions pre-baked, scale/opacity only — NOT internal-parts animation) → `svg-icon-enrichment` (its DOM contract only)
- center mockup → avatar morph (HF forbids `width`/`height` tweens → drive the reshape on `scaleX`/`scaleY`, anchor = the avatar layer rendered beneath) → `card-morph-anchor`
- radial bubble close-in (positions baked once via `cos`/`sin`, staggered entry) → `gsap-effects` (radial layout) + `spring-pop-entrance` (per-bubble arrival)
- low-amplitude float on background mockups/icons → `sine-wave-loop` (low-amplitude register — subtle jitter that composes onto each element's resting scale, never a `fromTo` yoyo that re-tweens to its start)
- (variant) zoom-out under accumulation → quick push-in → slow forward creep → `multi-phase-camera`
  (pull-back / push / drift as sequential phases on one world wrapper; counter-translate math in
  `viewport-change`)
- (variant) clutter shoved to the edges as the push-in lands → `center-outward-expansion` (outward
  vectors to edge resting positions), fired at the same timeline position as the camera push so the
  shove reads as CAUSED by it (`reactive-displacement` register)
- (variant) word-by-word serif question build → `gsap-effects` (staggered word reveal); the
  in-place line-1 → line-2 swap → `discrete-text-sequence`
- (variant) live typing inside windows → `gsap-effects` (typewriter); the continuous inner
  log-scroll — composition: looping content translateY via `gsap-effects` (masked)
- (variant) cursor glide-in coming to rest → `cursor-click-ripple` (approach portion only — no click)

**camera modifier**: camera-static — the close-in must read as the world crowding the subject, so the frame holds; a push-in would convert "surrounded" into "zoomed-into" and kill the claustrophobia. The clutter-shove-to-question variant is the sanctioned exception: there the camera IS the
storyteller (zoom-out ↔ push-in via `multi-phase-camera`), and the claustrophobia comes from
accumulation, not surround — never mix the two resolutions in one shot.

# Dynamic Content Sequencing

A utility pattern (not a motion rule in itself) for scenes that show a SEQUENCE of items (cards, phrases, stats): each item's duration is computed from its content length + per-item config, and the sequencer assigns absolute start/end times automatically — no hardcoded offsets per item. Distinct from [discrete-text-sequence](discrete-text-sequence.md) (one text element changing states) — this rule swaps between distinct content blocks.

## How It Works

A content array of `{ eyebrow, title, body, speedFactor, hold }` entries is reduced once at build time into a flat `TIMELINE` of `{ …entry, start, end }` — duration per entry is `BASE_DURATION + body.length × SEC_PER_CHAR + hold`, so longer text earns more reading time. A single linear driver's `onUpdate` reverse-searches the active entry and swaps the DOM **only on transitions** (a `lastTitle` guard — per-frame `textContent` writes flicker in render); an optional progress bar fills 0→100% across the whole run.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="display">
  <div class="eyebrow" id="eyebrow"></div>
  <div class="title" id="title"></div>
  <div class="body" id="body"></div>
  <div class="progress-bar"><div class="progress-fill" id="progress-fill"></div></div>
</div>
```

```css
.body {
  min-height: 160px; /* reserve space — content height varies; without this, layout jumps */
}
.progress-fill {
  height: 100%;
  width: 0%;
}
```

```js
// N entries, each with its own pacing (optionally a speedFactor multiplier);
// the final entry uses a larger hold (closing beat).
const CONTENT = [
  { eyebrow: "{eyebrow1}", title: "{title1}", body: "{body1}", hold: HOLD_MID },
  // …
  { eyebrow: "{eyebrowN}", title: "{titleN}", body: "{bodyN}", hold: HOLD_FINAL },
];

// Pre-compute absolute start/end ONCE — never in onUpdate.
let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry) => {
  const dur = BASE_DURATION + entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR + entry.hold;
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});

function entryAt(time) {
  for (let i = TIMELINE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= TIMELINE[i].start) return TIMELINE[i];
  }
  return TIMELINE[0];
}

const eyebrowEl = document.getElementById("eyebrow");
const titleEl = document.getElementById("title");
const bodyEl = document.getElementById("body");
const progressEl = document.getElementById("progress-fill");

const TOTAL_DURATION = cumulative + TAIL_PAD;
const driver = { t: 0 };
let lastTitle = "";

tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: TOTAL_DURATION,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const entry = entryAt(driver.t);
      // Swap content only on transitions — no per-frame DOM thrash
      if (entry.title !== lastTitle) {
        eyebrowEl.textContent = entry.eyebrow;
        titleEl.textContent = entry.title;
        bodyEl.textContent = entry.body;
        lastTitle = entry.title;
      }
      progressEl.style.width = `${(driver.t / TOTAL_DURATION) * 100}%`;
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Crossfade between items** — return BOTH adjacent entries during an overlap window (`time ≥ e.start − overlap && time ≤ e.end + overlap`, overlap ≈ 0.3s) and render them with opacities computed from distance to the boundary.
- **Per-item motion variation** — map an `entry.style` key to an existing rule per chapter (e.g. `3d-text-depth-layers` → `hacker-flip-3d` → `counting-dynamic-scale`); the sequencer only orchestrates timing.
- **Auto-extend composition duration** — you can set `data-duration` from the computed `TOTAL_DURATION` in script, but HF reads `data-duration` at composition load and setting it after init may not take effect — author the duration manually from a rough total.

### Accelerating cadence (geometric hold decay)

For rhetorical escalation — "everyone says…", a roll-call, a praise flurry — the beat grid itself accelerates: early entries hold ~1s (read speed), then windows shrink geometrically into a ~0.15–0.3s flurry, braking on an emphasis state before the resolve. The acceleration is pre-computed into the same flat `TIMELINE` — still content-driven, still deterministic, no speed-up tween anywhere:

```js
// Geometric decay on the hold, clamped at a flurry floor; the brake state holds longest.
const HOLDS = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => Math.max(FLURRY_FLOOR, HOLD_START * Math.pow(DECAY, i)));
HOLDS[CONTENT.length - 1] = HOLD_FINAL;

let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => {
  // Past ~0.5s states are glanced as motion texture, not read —
  // drop the per-char term or you never reach flurry speed.
  const readable = HOLDS[i] >= READ_THRESHOLD;
  const dur = HOLDS[i] + (readable ? entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR : 0);
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});
```

Worked example — **praise-chip flurry**: ~16 short quotes hard-cut through a chip beside a pinned wordmark. First 3 states at `HOLD_START = 1.0` (each reads fully); `DECAY = 0.8` shrinks every following window until `FLURRY_FLOOR = 0.2` catches it (≈12 states over ~2.5s — a churn of acclaim, individually glanced); the longest phrase takes `HOLD_FINAL ≈ 1.6` as the brake before the closing lockup.

Values: `HOLD_START` 0.8–1.2s; `DECAY` 0.75–0.88 (higher = longer runway before the flurry bites); `FLURRY_FLOOR` 0.15–0.3s (below ~0.15s swaps strobe); `READ_THRESHOLD` ~0.5s; brake ≥ 4× the floor or the stop doesn't register as a beat. The 3–6 entry guidance relaxes here — 12–18 states are legal precisely because flurry states aren't individually read. The hard-cut discipline (`lastTitle` guard, instant swaps) is what lets 0.2s states render clean.

| SEC_PER_CHAR  | 0.03–0.06 s/char      | ≈17–33 chars/sec; uniform across the sequence so the pace reads as one engine; lean high for wide-character languages |

| HOLD_FINAL    | 1.0–2.0s              | climax dwell — must exceed HOLD_MID by a clear margin so the close reads as a beat                                    |
| SPEED_FACTOR  | 0.5–2.0 (default 1.0) | per-entry only; if every entry shares a factor, fold it into SEC_PER_CHAR                                             |
| TAIL_PAD      | 0.0–1.0s              | quiet beat after the last entry; prefer 0 when the next composition owns the breath                                   |
| CONTENT N     | 3–6 entries           | <3 isn't a sequence; >6 drags (accelerating cadence relaxes this — see above)                                         |

## Critical Constraints

- **Pre-compute the TIMELINE once at build** — never recompute in `onUpdate`; the reverse search over the flat array is the whole per-frame cost.
- **DOM swap only on entry transition** (`lastTitle`/key guard) — per-frame `textContent` assignment flickers in HF render.
- **`min-height` on the body element** — without reservation, downstream elements (progress bar, brand) jitter as content height varies.
- **Sequential only** — for parallel tracks use a different reduction.
- **Titles fit one line at the chosen size; bodies fit inside `min-height` after wrapping.**

# Viewport Change (Virtual Camera)

Simulates camera effects (zoom / pan / focus-lock on a moving element) by transforming a wrapper around ALL scene content. The "world" moves opposite to the perceived camera. Distinct from [multi-phase-camera](multi-phase-camera.md) (2-3 discrete phases + drift) — viewport-change is a single continuous zoom/pan, often used for focus-lock following a moving element.

## How It Works

Camera intent → world transform. Camera **pans right** → world `translateX(-distance)`; camera **zooms in** → world `scale(>1)`; camera **follows element X** → world `translateX(viewportCenter - elementWorldX)` per-frame. Get the sign right or everything moves the wrong way. The single `.world` wrapper holds the camera transform; elements inside are positioned in world space, unchanged.

**Single-element composite transform (this rule's form).** Both scale and translate live on ONE wrapper as `translate(x, y) scale(S)`. CSS applies scale FIRST, then translate (right-to-left matrix composition), so a point at world offset `(ox, oy)` lands on screen at `(S × ox + x, S × oy + y)`. To map the target to viewport center, solve `S × offset + T = 0`:

```
T = -offset × S
```

This is **different from [coordinate-target-zoom](coordinate-target-zoom.md)**, which uses two nested wrappers (outer scales, inner translates) and derives `T = -offset` (independent of S). Mixing up the two forms drifts the target off-center as scale changes. Use this single-wrapper form when you want one source of truth for camera state (`cam.scale`, `cam.x`, `cam.y`) written via `onUpdate`; use nested wrappers when scale and translate can tween independently with shared ease.

function applyCamera() {
  world.style.transform = `translate(${cam.x}px, ${cam.y}px) scale(${cam.scale})`;
}
applyCamera(); // seed frame 0

// Zoom in on the CTA: single-element composite transform → T = -offset × S.
// TARGET_OFFSET_Y is the target's measured offset from viewport center at
// neutral camera (sign matters — positive = below center).
const counterY = -TARGET_OFFSET_Y * TARGET_SCALE;

## Scale Value Guide

| Effect      | Scale       | Feel                                |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Subtle      | 1.02 - 1.05 | Barely perceptible — "professional" |
| Medium      | 1.05 - 1.15 | "Ta-da" emphasis                    |
| Noticeable  | 1.15 - 1.30 | Focus on region                     |
| Dramatic    | 1.5 - 2.5   | Element fills screen                |
| Full-screen | 3.0+        | Element covers viewport             |

Perception: < 5% scale change is imperceptible; 10-15% is comfortable emphasis; > 30% is cinematic/dramatic. For a natural product feel, prefer 1.05-1.15× over 2-3s; save big > 1.3× zooms for dramatic narrative moments.

### Extreme range — 4–12× outward (workspace reveal)

The same single-cam math runs far past the table: a zoom-out workspace reveal opens punched-in at **4–12×** on one detail (a single cell, message, or button) and pulls out to the full workspace in one continuous move. The mechanics don't change — one `cam` object, `T = -offset × S`, one `applyCamera()` writer — only the authoring direction does:

- **Build the workspace at its final (1×) layout and OPEN scaled-in** (`cam.scale = 8`, counter-translate aiming the opening detail; state it in a `fromTo` / seed via `applyCamera()` so a seek to t=0 lands punched-in). The wide landing frame is then everything at native design size — text crisp, raster assets at source resolution.
- **Never the inverse** — authoring the close-up at 1× and scaling the world down to 0.08–0.25 for the wide frame drops every label below legible pixel size and softens raster media; the reveal lands on mush.
- **Measure the opening target** — at S = 8, a 1 px error in the baked offset is 8 px on screen at the opening pose. Take the offset from the target's real laid-out center (`getBoundingClientRect` after `fonts.ready`, once at setup — the measuring doctrine in [coordinate-target-zoom.md](coordinate-target-zoom.md)), never from a layout formula.
- **The opening detail must survive ×S** — it renders at `S ×` its design size on the first frames (vector/DOM text is safe; raster needs `sourceResolution ≥ rendered × S`).

## Variations

- **Focus-lock (camera follows a moving cursor/character)** — keep the element at a fixed screen X by computing the world offset per-frame inside the driver's `onUpdate`:

```js
const focusEl = document.querySelector(".moving-cursor");
const targetScreenX = VIEWPORT_WIDTH * FOCUS_SCREEN_X_FRAC; // 0.4–0.7; 0.5 = dead center
const focusUpdate = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  focusUpdate,
  {
    p: 1,
    duration: FOLLOW_DUR, // matches how long the focused element is in motion
    ease: "power2.inOut",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const rect = focusEl.getBoundingClientRect();
      cam.x = targetScreenX - (rect.left + rect.width / 2);
      applyCamera();
    },
  },
  FOLLOW_START,
);
```

- **Composite scale (multi-phase)** — two proxy tweens multiplied through one writer: `cam.scale = scaleUp.v * scaleDown.v; applyCamera()`. Combine a slow push-in (~1.15) with a brief release (~0.9) for a breath/punch shape.
- **Camera mode transition (centered → follow)** — crossfade two camera modes via a 0→1 weight tween; intermediate frames interpolate between the modes' offsets.

## Critical Constraints

- **One `.world` wrapper carries the whole camera** — every scene element lives inside it; a second transformed wrapper is a second camera.
- **Single source of truth via the `cam` object + `applyCamera()`** — when scale and translate both change, write them in ONE place; never split them across tweens that touch `world.style.transform` directly (the transform string composition order becomes unpredictable).
- **Single-wrapper counter-translate is `T = -offset × S`** — don't import the nested-wrapper `T = -offset` formula.
- **`overflow: hidden` on `.scene`**; **`transform-origin: 50% 50%` on `.world`**; **background on `.scene`, never on `.world`**.
